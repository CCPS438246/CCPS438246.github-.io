    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here?
In my personal life I'm working on finishing high school at Naples High. The things that led  me here is being a hardworking person another thing is how I manage my time and schedules.  

How am I working toward these goals?
I'm working toward these goals by paying attention in school and to study  on my own time. I can also work toward that goal by taking notes in a way I can understand or learn from them because if you take the notes and you can't understand it what's the point of taking them. 

What values do I consider most necessary for my success?
A value that I consider most necessary is for my success is being determined. When you are determined and put your mind to it nothing can stop you from being successful not even people who look down on you at your worst time.  

What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future?
My short-term goal that I hope to accomplish is my screen time and to develop a study timetable. Having less time on my phone will help me try things that I wasn't able to do and having a study timetable helps you remember to always study with that you can understand better and work hard for the future. 

What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for?
A character trait I want people to be known for is being determined. I want to help other remember not to give up or if you put your mind in to something you can do it. I want people to remember to not let one bad thing ruin your dream or one bad comment to make you lose hope.  </p>
